# Task-Manager
This code accompanies the Task Management system created in Notion, which can be found here: [https://purrfect-iberis-43b.notion.site/Home-Template-a6e3fa6374524372a45bd78ac33d60e9?pvs=74](https://purrfect-iberis-43b.notion.site/Home-Template-a6e3fa6374524372a45bd78ac33d60e9?pvs=74)
Use the 'Duplicate' button to copy the setup to your own account.
I have noticed some issues with the Notion website and Firefox, so try to use another browser if the above link does not work.


This system is completely free charge. If you want to thank me for my efforts, you can consider buying me a lactose-free cappuccino through a donation using this link: [https://betaalverzoek.rabobank.nl/betaalverzoek/?id=w4JeJzm6Sx-DZawQ7WW1lg](https://betaalverzoek.rabobank.nl/betaalverzoek/?id=w4JeJzm6Sx-DZawQ7WW1lg) (Valid until June 27, 2024; will be updated)
